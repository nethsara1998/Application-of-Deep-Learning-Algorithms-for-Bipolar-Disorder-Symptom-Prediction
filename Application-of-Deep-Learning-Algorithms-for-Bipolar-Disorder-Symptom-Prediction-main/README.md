Bipolar disorder also known as manic depression is a mental illness causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. In between those periods, they usually feel normal. The idea was that both patients and psychiatrists can be supported by making a better diagnosis of this disease with the use of new technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence). Deep Learning is a subset of AI which makes artificial neural networks that mimic human brain.The main goal of this project is to apply different deep learning algorithms to symptom-based patient data in order to create prediction models and find the best performing deep learning model.
